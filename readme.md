## Introduction

This laboratory course is intended to enhance the learning experience of the student in topics encountered in the subject Control Systems. This course is intended to provide assistance in solving computational problems associated with the study and application of linear control systems using MATLAB.  MATLAB is an interactive system for scientific and engineering computation. The first objective is to introduce the user to some of the capabilities of *MATLAB*, and the associated *Control System Toolbox*, so that it can be used to aid in the design and analysis of control systems. The second objective is to teach the student how to write MATLAB programs and to allow them to advance rapidly in solving more advanced control system problems.

## Course Goals and Objectives

The laboratory course on Control Systems-I is designed to provide the student with the knowledge to write MATLAB programs on control system problems. More explicitly, the course objectives are:

1.	To gain proficiency in the use of MATLAB software.
2.	To enhance understanding of linear control systems concepts using control system toolbox available in the MATLAB software.

3.	To compare manually solved problems with computationally obtained results using the software.
